## The Problem
Many people struggle to understand where their money goes each month. The standard way a lot of people track their expenses is through an Excel sheet where they manually export the transactions from their bank then import it into the excel sheet. This can be time-consuming and error-prone. Due to this, a lot of people don't regularly review their financial health.

I wanted to create a solution that automatically aggregates financial data, and all it requires the user to do is to connect the bank account that they want to track. I also wanted the interface to be intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy for users to understand their financial health at a glance.

## My Solution
ZenWealth is a personal finance application that connects to users' bank accounts via the Plaid API, allowing them to track expenses, manage budgets, and analyze spending patterns. The app provides a secure, user-friendly interface for monitoring financial health without the hassle of manual data entry.

## Plaid
To be able to connect to the user's bank account, I used Plaid, a financial services company that provides a secure way to access users' bank accounts. Plaid allows developers to connect with users' bank accounts and retrieve transaction data without storing sensitive credentials using OAuth.

OAuth allows you as a developer to specify what areas of the user's bank account you want to access to such as transaction history, account balances, and account details. This way, users can securely connect their bank accounts to ZenWealth without without storing their bank credentials in the app.

## Backend
I developed the backend of this website using ASP.NET Core, leveraging my prior experience with the framework. Initially, I structured the architecture into traditional Presentation, Services, and Data layers. However, to ensure greater maintainability, testability, and scalability, I transitioned to a hexagonal architecture.

<FigImage src="/projects/zenwealth/hexagonal-arch.svg" alt="Hexagonal Architecture" />

To optimize performance and reduce reliance on external APIs, transaction data from the Plaid API is stored in a database. This data is efficiently updated via Plaid webhooks whenever new information becomes available, preventing the overhead of redundant API requests.

### Database
I started with SQL Server for my database, but the need for more convenient hosting led me to PostgreSQL.

My initial hosting attempt with Azure's free tier proved problematic. Database queries frequently timed out because the free tier automatically powered down the server during periods of inactivity, which was a big issue for end users.

To resolve this, I switched to a PostgreSQL database hosted on my Hetzner VPS. This allowed me to maintain a continuously running database server without constant idlying.

For the Database Schema I used five different tables:
- **Users**: Stores user information and authentication details.
- **Accounts**: Contains information about the bank accounts linked to the user.
- **Transactions**: Records individual transactions associated with each account.
- **Budgets**: Manages user-defined budgets for different categories.
- **Items**: Represents the institutions (banks) linked to the user's accounts.

<FigImage src="/projects/zenwealth/db-tables.png" alt="Database Schema" />

To ensure scalability, I chose to use keyset pagination for the transactions, which allows for efficient retrieval of large datasets without performance degradation.
This approach is particularly useful when dealing with extensive transaction histories vs traditional offset-based pagination, which can become inefficient as more and more transaction data is stored.

I used Entity Framework Core to interact with the database and write the SQL queries. This allows me to swap out the database provider without having to rewrite the queries. This is especially useful for adhering to the hexagonal architecture principles as it would be easier to create a new adapter for a different database provider.

### Email Notifications
To keep users informed about their financial activities, I implemented an email notification system using Azure. This system sends notifications and verification emails to users, enhancing the overall user experience and security of the application.

## Frontend
The frontend of ZenWealth is built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I chose to use Tailwind CSS as it allows for rapid development of responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. Shadcn UI components were used as they are easily customizable and are already built with Tailwind CSS, allowing me to focus more on the functionality rather than the styling.

The frontend communicates with the backend via a JSON API, as Plaid advises using a separate backend and frontend so that the backend can securely handle certain actions. For Example, the Link flow that authorizes the user's bank account needs to retrieve a token from the backend, swap it once the user completes their bank authorization, then send it back to the server.

### Dashboard

The dashboard page is the first thing that the user sees when they login, so I decided to make it give the user an overview of their financial health. It shows the user's various monthly metrics at a glance like the balance, expenditure, savings & income in the first section.

![ZenWealth Dashboard](/projects/zenwealth/Dashboard.png)

In the following section, the user can see their recent transactions, and they get the option of viewing both income and expenses together or separately. They also get a line grapgh of how their income compares to their expenses over the past year.

Finally, you a bunch of other cards that display things like the budget status, liabilities and top expense categories.

### Accounts

The accounts page is all about the connected bank accounts, so I made sure to highlight the user's current networth as as the first thing they see when on the page. Afterwards, they can view two pie charts which contain their assets and liabilities.

![ZenWealth Accounts](/projects/zenwealth/Accounts.png)

Throughout the page they get different ways to view the accounts either through an accordion or a bar chart. Clicking on the pie chart sector or the bar chart section scrolls and highlights the relevant account in the accordion.

### Transactions

Arguably the part I spent the most time on, the transactions page is where users can view all their transactions in a table. They can filter the transactions by date, account, and category. They can also search for specific transactions by name and sort by either the date or amount.

![ZenWealth Transactions](/projects/zenwealth/Transactions.png)

The UI of the table was created using Tanstack table which makes it easy to create a responsive and interactive table. It also allows for features like sorting, filtering, pagination & column visibility.

### Budgets

In the budgets page, users can create and manage their budgets. They can set a budget for a specific category and track their progress towards that budget. The page also shows the user's total budget and how much they have spent so far.

![ZenWealth Budgets](/projects/zenwealth/Budgets.png)

I also give the user the option to set a different start date for their budget, so that they can align it with their pay cycle. This is especially useful for users who get paid bi-weekly or on a different day than end / beginning of the month.
