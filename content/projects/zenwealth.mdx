## The Problem
Many people struggle to understand where their money goes each month. The standard way a lot of people track their expenses is through an excel sheet where they manually export the transaction from their bank then import it into the excel sheet. This can be time-consuming and error-prone, due to this, a lot of people don't regularly review their financial health.

I wanted to create a solution that automatically aggregates financial data and all it requires the user to do is to connect the banks account that they want to track. I also wanted the interface to be intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy for users to understand their financial health at a glance.

## My Solution
ZenWealth is a personal finance application that connects to users' bank accounts via the Plaid API, allowing them to track expenses, manage budgets, and analyze spending patterns. The app provides a secure, user-friendly interface for monitoring financial health without the hassle of manual data entry.

## Plaid
In order to be able to connect to the user's bank account, I used Plaid, a financial services company that provides a secure way to access users' bank accounts. Plaid allows developers to connect with users' bank accounts and retrieve transaction data without storing sensitive credentials using OAuth.

OAuth allows you as a developer to specify what areas of the user's bank account you want to access to such as transaction history, account balances, and account details. This way, users can securely connect their bank accounts to ZenWealth without without storing their bank credentials in the app.
