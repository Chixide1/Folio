## The Problem
Many people struggle to understand where their money goes each month. Existing finance apps are either too basic or overly complex, and manually tracking expenses across multiple accounts is time-consuming and error-prone. I wanted to create a solution that automatically aggregates financial data and provides actionable insights without overwhelming the user.

## My Solution
ZenWealth connects to users' bank accounts via Plaid's secure API, automatically categorizes transactions, and provides intelligent budgeting tools with visual spending analytics. The platform gives users a complete financial overview while maintaining bank-level security.

### Key Features I Built
- **Automated Transaction Tracking**: Real-time sync with multiple bank accounts, credit cards, and savings accounts
- **Smart Budgeting System**: Category-based budgets with progress tracking and overspending alerts
- **Financial Analytics**: Visual insights into spending patterns, income vs. expenses, and net worth calculations
- **Secure Bank Integration**: Plaid API integration for safe, read-only access to financial data
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Clean, intuitive interface that works across all devices

Detailed analytics help users understand spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core for robust API development and business logic
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type-safe, maintainable UI code
- **Database**: SQL Server for reliable financial data storage
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn components for consistent, modern design

### Key Challenges Solved

**Secure Financial Data Handling**
Implemented Plaid's secure API integration to safely access bank data without storing sensitive credentials. All financial data is encrypted and follows banking security standards.

**Real-time Data Synchronization**
Built webhook handlers to automatically update transactions and account balances when changes occur at the bank level, ensuring users always see current information.

**Intelligent Transaction Categorization**
Developed logic to automatically categorize transactions using merchant data and user patterns, reducing manual input while maintaining accuracy.

**Performance Optimization**
Implemented efficient data querying and caching strategies to handle large transaction datasets without impacting user experience.
