## The Perfect Pairing for Your Backend

When it comes to building server-side applications with Node.js, choosing the right framework and ORM is crucial for long-term success. NestJS, with its modular architecture and use of TypeScript, provides a solid foundation for building scalable services. When paired with Prisma, a next-generation ORM, you get a seamless and type-safe database workflow.

### Why NestJS and Prisma?

* **TypeScript First:** Both tools fully leverage TypeScript to provide incredible autocompletion, type safety, and developer confidence.
* **Modular Architecture:** NestJS encourages a well-structured application, making it easy to manage as it grows.
* **Declarative Schema:** Define your database schema with Prisma's intuitive modeling language, and let it handle the migrations and query generation.

This tutorial will guide you through every step, from `npm init` to a fully functional REST API with CRUD operations.
