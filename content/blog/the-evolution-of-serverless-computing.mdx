## The Paradigm Shift

Serverless computing represents a fundamental shift in how we think about deploying and managing applications. Instead of provisioning and maintaining servers, developers can now leverage function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms to execute code in response to events. This model abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. We will explore the key benefits and challenges of adopting a serverless approach.

### Key Benefits:

* **Reduced Operational Cost:** Pay only for the compute time you consume.
* **Scalability:** Automatically scales with the number of requests.
* **Developer Velocity:** Faster time-to-market by focusing on features.
