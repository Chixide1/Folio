## Reshaping the Web

For years, Flexbox and Grid have been the cornerstones of modern web layout. However, the CSS landscape is continually evolving. New specifications are giving developers unprecedented power to create responsive, maintainable, and sophisticated designs directly in the stylesheet, often without needing JavaScript.

### What We'll Cover:

1.  **Container Queries:** Say goodbye to page-based media queries. Style components based on their own size for truly modular design.
2.  **Cascade Layers:** Gain explicit control over the CSS cascade. This feature helps manage styles from different sources (like libraries, frameworks, and your own code) without specificity wars.
3.  **The `:has()` Selector:** Often called the "parent selector," `:has()` allows you to select an element based on its descendants, unlocking new and powerful styling patterns.

This post will provide practical examples for each of these features, demonstrating how you can start using them to build better UIs today.
